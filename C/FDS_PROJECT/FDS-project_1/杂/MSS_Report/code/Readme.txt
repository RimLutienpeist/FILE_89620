Open the. c file and compile and run it.

Program input: First, enter the size n of the matrix or enter 0 to exit the program,

Then input the elements of the matrix,

Then enter the function you want to use (1, 2, 3),

Then the result will be output.

Afterwards, the above operation can be repeated to continue testing.

You can modify the global variables' iteration 'and' N ', where the former represents the number of function repetitions and the latter is the number of test repetitions (N defaults to 10, which means the program will automatically test ten times and output the average result)
