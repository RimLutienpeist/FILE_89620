## Image-based Rendering

rendering: from 3D models to images.

Image-based Rendering: images -> 3D Models -> novel views.

representations:

- Textured Mesh (surface-based representations)
- Light Fields and Lumigraphs
    - 牺牲了一个方向，减少了一个纬度
    - 只能内采样
- Depth Warping
- Multi-plane Images (MPI) (volume-based representations)
    - rgba x multi planes
    - Neural Volumes
- Neural Radiance Fields
